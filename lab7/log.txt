I run the command

$ sort --version

in order to check if I have a new enough version of GNU sort. This is the message I get:

I seem to have an older version than 8.6, but I specifically chose this coreutils file for being 8.6, released 2010-10-15, which is strange.

I create a script, generate20mfile.sh, containing the following commands in order to generate a list of 10,000,000 double-precision floating point numbers with standard\
 input taken from /dev/urandom, formatted to be one per line with no white space:

od -An -t f8 -N 80000000 </dev/urandom | tr -s "[:blank:]" "\n" > 10milnums.txt

Note: 80,000,000 is an argument passed into the N option which dictates how many bytes of memory should be generated in the file. Since we want 10 million double-precis\
ion floating point numbers, we must multiply by 8.

Execute it, thereby creating the file 10milnums.txt:
$ ./generate10mfile.sh

My next task is to use 10milnums.txt to record the perofrmance time of the default installed sort command,
[classhae@lnxsrv05 ~/hw7]$ time -p sort -g 10milnums.txt > /dev/null
real 178.93
user 175.17
sys 0.25

[classhae@lnxsrv07 ~/hw7]$ time -p sort -g --parallel 1 10milnums.txt > /dev/null
real 183.21
user 182.86
sys 0.34

[classhae@lnxsrv07 ~/hw7]$ time -p sort -g --parallel 2 10milnums.txt > /dev/null
real 99.38
user 190.23
sys 0.39

[classhae@lnxsrv07 ~/hw7]$ time -p sort -g --parallel 4 10milnums.txt > /dev/null
real 56.09
user 193.16
sys 0.47
[classhae@lnxsrv07 ~/hw7]$ time -p sort -g --parallel 8 10milnums.txt > /dev/null
real 35.48
user 197.56
sys 0.55

NOTE: the --parallel option did not work unless on LINUX srver 07. Not sure if it had to do with the PATH environment variable being set improperly so that /usr/local/c\
s/bin was not at its start...
